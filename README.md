## What does sharefest SMS depend on?
* [Django3.0](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/)
* [django-phone-field](https://pypi.org/project/django-phone-field/)
* [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python)
* [Python3.x](https://www.python.org)
* [SQLite](https://https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
* when this is finally pushed to production

## Config

1. Clone the repo

2. after installing Django and site dependencies, navigate to 
   the folder containing the site and run
   ```sh
   $ python manage.py runserver
   ```
   this will start the server at your local host, usually at 127.0.0.1:8000. 
   This is the home page shown above

3. since the DB is still public, you will have the full collection of accounts and 
   contacts. Once the DB is private, you will have to create your own collections of users if you are not working on the production machine

4. 127.0.0.1/admin will bring you to the Admin panel
